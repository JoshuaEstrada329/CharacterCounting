# CharacterCounting
When ran from the command line user are required to give two parameters. The file path of the inputfile they
wish to have the ASCII characters counted and the file path for the outputfile they wish to have the
program write the Character Frequenies too.

If a tester does not wish to use the command line they can replace the args[1] and args[2] with the commentted
out file paths for the two parameters along with the check in the beggining for parameters.
